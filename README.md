# Automated-Generation-of-MCQ-Using-cGANs
This research introduces an innovative approach to automatically generating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), tailored for computer science education. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset sourced from over 20 sub-domains, including textbooks, encyclopedias, and Q&A platforms. It effectively produces contextually relevant MCQs across varying difficulty levels and topics. The generated questions are evaluated using metrics such as Question Relevance Score (QRS), Diversity Index (DI), and Difficulty Alignment Accuracy (DAA), confirming the modelâ€™s reliability and quality. Ethical considerations like fairness, transparency, and accountability are carefully addressed, ensuring responsible AI use in education. Additionally, the framework features a user-friendly QT-based application for seamless integration into both classroom and online learning environments. This interdisciplinary work empowers educators with an efficient and flexible tool for automated assessment, enhancing student engagement, personalizing learning experiences, and contributing to improved educational outcomes in computer science.
