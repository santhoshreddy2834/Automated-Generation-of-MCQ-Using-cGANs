# Automated-Generation-of-MCQ-Using-cGANs

This work presents a novel approach to generating automated multiple-choice questions 
(MCQs) in the field of computer science education, which is characterized by its dynamic and 
diverse nature across multiple sub-domains. The proposed model leverages the power of 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically Conditional GANs (cGANs), to create 
contextually relevant MCQs that span various proficiency levels and topic areas. The model is 
trained on a robust dataset derived from over 20 subareas in computer science, including 
textbooks, online encyclopedias, and Q&A websites. The result is a versatile MCQ generator 
capable of supporting a wide range of educational contexts, from classroom environments to 
online courses and exams. The MCQs produced are evaluated rigorously using performance 
metrics such as Question Relevance Score (QRS), Diversity Index (DI), and Difficulty 
Alignment Accuracy (DAA), demonstrating the framework's robustness in delivering high
quality questions. This work also addresses the ethical considerations associated with AI
driven educational assessment, ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability throughout 
the process. Furthermore, the frameworkâ€™s user-friendly QT application ensures easy 
integration into educational systems. This interdisciplinary research advances computer 
science education by providing educators with a flexible, efficient tool that enhances student 
engagement and improves learning outcomes.
